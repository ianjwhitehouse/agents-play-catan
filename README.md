# Agents Play Games Together

## Overview
This projects examines how two AI systems, with different personalities, can compete against eachother.  It is still a work in progress as I initially wanted to implement it in Catan, which was probably too complicated.  Right now, I have a working battleship environment, but it will need to be refined before people can play/watch the AIs play the game.
